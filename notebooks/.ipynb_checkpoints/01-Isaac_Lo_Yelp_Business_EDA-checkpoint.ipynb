I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed.

       "  'text': \"Tuna Bar is a new sushi digs in Old City, a relatively upscale neighborhood in a city flooded with mediocre sushi restaurants. I frequent laban's favorites, bubblefish being one of them and the last visit left something to be desired. The fork in the road left me with two options, Royal Izakaya or Tuna Bar, and boy am I glad I chose the latter.\\n\\nThe ambiance is on point, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The menu is curated beautifully, from my understanding they narrowed it down quite a bit from the other location. This means everything on the menu is guaranteed to be fantastic and FRESH.\\n\\nWe started with the steamed chicken dumplings which were light and steamed to perfection. The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet. And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. \\n\\nFor our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here. Ken was also present and very humble about my compliments.\\n\\n6/5\",\n",

The space is really neat. It has an inviting, laid back, retro atmosphere. I felt like I spent the first few minutes just taking in the scenery. They did an excellent job with the decor. We were seated immediately and our server promptly offered us water and drink menus. She was awesome! We ordered edamame and the chicken/shrimp dumplings. Both were very good. We ordered 6 rolls (each came with at least 8 pieces regardless of it being a special or house roll). We got 2 spicy salmon, yellowtail scallion, spider, dragon and the Old City. They were all VERY good. Highly recommend. Even the platters that the food was served on were well thought through. A manager came over to our table to ask us how our experience was.

We then ordered another roll to supplement which was fine. Overall a $108 meal for 2 worth $60. Not going back.',\n",

The tuna tartar had potential, but needed some finishing salt and maybe a little heat and/or crunch to make it more interesting. \\n\\nOrdered three rolls and they were awful.  The spicy tuna and the unagi rolls contained this weird mixture, which I assume was pureed fish.  I've never experienced that before.  The salmon rolls had too much rice and the seaweed was too thick.  We slathered the rolls in soy sauce and wasabi to make them more palatable. \\n\\nOrdered three pieces of sushi.  They were some of the largest pieces of sushi I've ever had. The salmon was not fresh.  The hamachi was boring.  The striped bass, which was the cheapest of the sushis, was actually the most flavorful. \\n\\nA crisp Riesling is usually a good accompaniment to sushi.  Unfortunately, there is not one on the menu.  The one they had was cloyingly sweet, with no acid or fruit.  It wasn't even finished!  The pinot noir was too earthy.

With the wall facing the street being all windows, the inside was flooded with natural light. They had a quite large sushi and bar counter in the middle, with seating all around it. They also had small two-person booth seating on the side as well. Very clean decor, I am glad they didn\\'t put up any kind of cheap or fake Asian \"artworks\" on the wall.\\n\\nWe ordered an appetizer and side dish to go with our sushi rolls. We chose Creamy Rock Shrimp, Lobster Fried Rice, Sindy Roll and Old City Roll. All in all, they were all very tasty, high quality and we enjoyed them very much. Yes, everything was perfect until we ordered some desserts... \\n\\nSince they didn\\'t have a dessert menu, we ordered Tree Cake and Green Tea Cheesecake based on the description of the dessert that our waitress gave us. \\n\\nThis so-called Tree Cake...I call it \"rip-off\" cake. Our waitress described it as a cake made with almond, egg and butter. When it came out, I was shocked what it really was... If you are familiar with a common and popular sweets in Japan, one of them is called Baumkuchen which is actually a German layered cake. They can be purchased from most bakeries and stores, and not so pricey unless you go to some fancy boutique to get it. The cake we were presented with, in my opinion, was store-bought, and sliced as thinly as possible. For $10, you can buy an entire cake!!! Very disappointing... And on top of that, it was dry (with these thin slices being cut off from the cake, I wonder how long it has been since the cake was first purchased?). And if that is not enough, we were given spoons to eat this...why? I don\\'t know...\\n\\nOur waitress was very friendly and polite, and we were well taken care of. Everything we had, other than the Tree Cake was great. High quality and tasty, a bit on pricey side, but that comes with the quality. I wish if we made a different choice with the dessert. But then, you live and you learn. If you go there, avoid the tree cake!',\n",

Atmosphere was lovely and our service was mostly excellent.\\n\\nWok Kampachi Ceviche app: Delicious! Sweet, savory, umami yumminess.\\nTuna tartare app: This was the only dish that I would not order again. The tuna was super fresh but it came too cold and bland. If you are hoping for something akin to the tuna tartare at Morimoto's, this is not it.\\nLychee martini- The first one I had was very sweet without enough tang. The second one was better. I would order again. I would suggest that the bar get some fresh lychee to garnish the drink in the future. My first came with flower petals, my second came with a dried orange slice.\\n\\nRolls:\\nSindy: Excellent! Favorite roll of the night. I had never had a roll without rice before and I'm a convert. Everything was fresh and presented just right. No weird temperature issues with the crispy eel. I'm coming back to this place because of this roll.\\nDynamite White Tuna - Best spicy tuna I've had.\\nDragon roll - this is a standard sushi offering. Getting it here will make you happy. Quality ingredients, perfect combo.\\nPeppered tuna - the most understated of the rolls we had. Kind of like a tuna salad flavor. I liked the daikon. You might want to start instead of end with this roll. It did not wow me after the others I had with the bold flavors.\\n\\nSmall issue- No soy sauce on our table so we had to grab one from a neighboring table.\\n\\nWe'll be back for the Sindy!\",\n",

Though the specialty roll (J&J) was almost double the price of the regular roll, there was definitely more going on and it was a lot more filling. I'd recommend getting at least one specialty roll. Still, the normal rolls such as the peppered tuna was refreshing to eat.\\n\\nI also noticed that they have pretty exclusive sushi such as uni, el toro, kobe, and live clams.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Very disappointing to have to give this place 2 stars considering I live across the street and really wanted to like it here. We dined in on a Sunday around 6pm. The place wasn't very crowded and there seemed to be an abundance of servers, but we sat waiting at the table for about 15 minutes before the waitress even came to fill our water. We ordered right away and the food came out relatively quickly, but nothing really wowed me. We started with the fried brussel sprouts which were tasty but not as good as ones I've had elsewhere (I'm looking at you, Sampan). I had miso soup which was fine but served in a large bowl and filled not even a quarter of the way. Definitely not worth the $6. We shared the lobster fried rice which was okay- not an abundance of lobster and a consistency that made it very difficult to eat with chopsticks. Finally we got 3 sushi rolls (2 house rolls and a special roll). They were tasty but not spectacular and had a tendency to fall apart easily. I did appreciate the presentation of the rolls served on a large wooden platter. All together our bill was $70 (no drinks) which was definitely not worth it for what we received. Overall it was overpriced and nothing special. I will say the ambiance was nice however the music was a bit too loud. I probably will not be going back.\",\n",

I absolutely love sushi, but when you add an awesome location, fabulous and trendy decor, reasonable prices and outstanding service, you've got a GEM!!! Ok so my sister and i decided to have a sushi lunch date and I'd been hearing about this place and how amazing the ambience and sushi was, not to mention I follow this IG page and the pictorial post are always so mouth watering. Anyway, once we stepped into the restaurant I was immediately impressed and knew we were in for a treat, once we were seated and began glancing over the menu, my mouth began salivating immediately! OMG!!! The options are endless and my inner greedy girl wanted to order EVERYTHING off the menu! We however opted for the brussel sprouts, fried oysters and the tuna tartare as our appetizers, all were to die for delicious! We chose a few sushi roll options to split and as stuffed as i was that inner greedy girl savored every single bite, till it was all gone!!! I could really eat here EVERY day! The sushi is so fresh and good! I can honestly say, the best I've had! What an absolute GEM! This restaurant is good for any occasion (date night, girl's night, single girl night) it doesn't matter, you'll totally be blown away!\",\n",

I'm glad we did, this is the best sushi I've had in a very long time and I couldn't be more impressed. The owner, Ken, came to our table and introduced himself and made recommendations for what to try on the menu. We ended up ordering several appetizers and then a ton of sushi to share and it was fabulous. I'm usually just stick with sashimi and sushi, and skip the rolls, and I finally found a place with excellent fish that doesn't need to be drizzled in spicy mayo or eel sauce to taste good.

The weather was nice so they had their sliding doors open in which you could feel the breeze and the environment from the outside but also feel like you were part of the upscale dining environment in doors. From either end of the table you got views from the restaurant and from the outside which I thought was magnificent. \\n\\nThe restaurant per say is beautiful, it has very chic. modern and elegant decor. They have leather booths and small tables and a nice design throughout the restaurant. The music is audible but not extremely loud that disrupts your conversation. \\n\\nThe service was also very good and our waitress was very pleasant. \\n\\nAs for the meal everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We tried the shishito peppers which were perfectly seasoned and the fried Brussels sprouts which were also perfectly crunchy.

The desserts were also good but not mind blowing (this was the only ok part of our meal).

The decor is relatively simple but very clean and modern. \\n\\nWe had the tuna tartare & wagyu egg rolls to start. The tuna tartare was delicious- very refreshing & the flavors were amazing. The egg rolls were good- nothing too out of this world but still very tasty. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Fishtown roll, salmon/avocado rolls & the peppered tuna roll. The Fishtown roll is just the right amount of spice to it. The avocado in the roll was creamy and delicious. I wasn't a fan of the peppered tuna roll but my boyfriend really liked it. \\n\\nA few rounds & a few rolls will cost you a few dollars, but definitely worth it for a night out with loved ones.\\n\\nWill def be back!\",\n",

We were all really impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant (even if we did get blasted with cold air every time someone new entered).\\n\\nWe started with the pork gyoza and fried oysters. When we asked our server how many oysters came in an order, she said 2 per order. We ordered two so that all of us could try an oyster. When the plates came out, there were three gigantic oysters on each of them. So, we really didn't need to order 2 at all. The oysters were OK, nothing special. They mostly tasted like breading. The gyoza were disappointing. They really didn't have much flavor and tasted basically like plain ol' pork sausage.\\n\\nThe actual sushi itself was really good, though. I got some salmon sushi, a yellowtail and chive roll with scallion oil, and a spicy tuna roll. I loved the sushi - it was so tender and melted in your mouth. I also can't say enough good things about the yellowtail/chive/scallion roll. It was...really unique and delicious. I would definitely order that again and advise that you try it for yourself!\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal here. I thought their cocktail list left a lot to be desired and that the price for everything was too steep for what you actually got. While I won't be making any grand effort to return, I wasn't dissatisfied with my meal here.\",\n",

Tuna Bar may be the cities second best option in terms of the variety of fish offered and quality.\\n\\nNice modern restaurant in Old City located on the main floor of a condo building. Service was excellent on both my visits. You can take your time and enjoy the meal, have a drink or two. Nice laid back atmosphere.\\n\\nA few appetizers stood out for me - Wagyu beef spring roles, Seaweed salad, Sashimi salad and I loved the Grandmom's wonton soup.  \\n\\nThe Tuna Bar is at its best serving fresh sushi / sashimi.  I was with larger groups so got to try many of the house rolls which were mostly good but I was happiest ordering from the Sushi A La-Carte section of the menu. The fish was incredibly fresh and not the same boring pieces (i.e. Salman, Tuna, Ebi etc....) served at the 100+ sushi restaurants in Philadelphia.   \\n\\nLoved the variety of fatty tuna options (Toro and Otoro but no Chutoro when I was there - different options available depending on the day), 1-2 Uni choices, Maguro, Kampachi, Striped Bass, Hamachi and Unagi.  \\n\\nIf you want above average sushi options / quality, give the Tuna Bar a try. Prices are above average but to be expected given the variety and quality. \\n\\nRecommended\\n\\nBK\",\n",

After making the reservation and realizing we weren\\'t able to preview the prix fixe menu, I decided to contact the restaurant since my boyfriend has a shellfish allergy and this can often be a problem with sushi. I called, no answer. So I messaged them via Facebook. I explained his allergy and asked if this would be issue with the menu and their exact response was \"...confirmed with management and there will be no shellfish on tonight\\'s menu...\" (See pic) \\n\\nGreat, so we went. As soon as we sat down and looked at the menu we realized almost half of it included shrimp aka SHELLFISH (see V-day menu pic). Now maybe they were unaware that shrimp is shellfish? Or maybe they were just too lazy to actually check when I inquired, but either way, it\\'s pretty inexcusable to ignore someone\\'s food allergies and risk a health scare. What if we had asked if a dish included shellfish and my boyfriend had eaten it due to their ignorance? We would have ended up at the hospital. \\n\\nI\\'m giving three stars because our waiter did his best to accommodate us once we were already seated and expecting a decent meal. The sushi roll  that he subbed for the 6th course (didn\\'t have a name, his creation) was pretty quality and we did really enjoy it. I just can\\'t get past the staff\\'s ignorance regarding food allergies and a $210 dinner with drinks that we didn\\'t really get to enjoy.',\n",

The wantons are not in soup, they are just in hot water. It's not even salty hot water it's literally just water.

I am always on the hunt for good sushi in philly and almost every place I've been to left something to be desired.Tuna bar served fresh sushi and well seasoned soba noodles that not only satisfied but had my friends raving about their next return. You know it's a good meal when we are talking about our next visit!\\nSince we had a 5pm reservation we were able to partake in their happy hour specials which included drinks and $5-$7 sushi rolls. It was a great deal considering the quality and ambience. For the sushi we went with the classics spicy tuna, spicy salmon and the salmon avocados. They were able to accommodate for my friend's wheat allergy but giving her gluten free soy sauce. The waiter was very patient and thorough with making sure my friend did not encounter any wheat products. Besides our sushi, my other friend got the chicken dumplings and the avocado ginger salad, which were both excellent. We also happened to come on a particularly beautiful day so the doors were open and they had a photographer take pictures of their new menu items. One of which is this stunning cocktail called 1912 which is inspired by the cherry blossoms in DC. The bartender sprinkled hibiscus dust on top and garnished it with beautiful flowers. It was light and refreshing and not too sweet. It also doesn't hurt that it is a beautiful work of art!\\nLastly we had our sweet ending with the dark chocolate sesame ice cream. The chocolate was overpowering the sesame to be honest, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. My only qualm was that the bowl and plates are a bit uneven so it's not ideal for serving.

       "  'text': 'When this place opened up down the street my husband and I were super excited that the neighborhood was starting to fill up with nice restaurants. We went in to check it out last night and we were not disappointed. Everything was amazing! The staff is super friendly, the ambiance is really beautiful, modern and chic but still comfortable and the food is out of this world. I mean, seriously. We\\'ve been to tons of other sushi places in the city and this was the best of the best. We had a bunch of sashimi, scallops, fried oysters (omg, so good), fried lobster rice and rock shrimp. The scallops were my husbands fave, I really loved the oysters and the rock shrimp. Everything was so fresh and so full of flavor. The sashimi was so fresh and \"melt-in-your-mouth\" that it sort of seemed insulting to put soy sauce anywhere near it.  We also had really great cocktails, I highly recommend trying the gin-cucumber-wasabi drink. (I can\\'t remember what it\\'s called, maybe Winston Heat? Wilson Heat? Something like that) I really can\\'t wait to go back to this place, it\\'s so perfect for date night.',\n",

However, this was the turning point in our dining experience. We ordered the Fried Oysters, J&J Roll, and 2 sets of the Large Omakase Sushi set. During our ordering process, we had asked the server how many pieces of sushi come in the small and the large sets for the omakase and they responded with 5 and 10 pieces respectively.\\n\\nThe fried oysters we received came with very little sauce and when we bit into it there was a squirt of seawater and kind of fishy taste to it.\\n\\nThe J&J roll was well seasoned and each roll had a good balance of flavors and sauce. However, when you eat the fish laying on top, there was almost no flavor and almost had a hard texture to it. Something one wouldnt expect when eating raw fish.\\n\\nThe omakase came out with 8 pieces instead of 10 pieces as stated previously. The excuse we received was because we got to eat Otoro (fatty tuna). There was also no explanation of each piece nor sauce that we received. The sushi itself was something that you would expect out of a supermarket sushi bar, premade and refrigerated.\\n\\nOverall, for the price paid compared to the quality of service and food that you receive, I would not recommend this restaurant.

When it was barely 9:30pm chairs were brought in from outside and were stacked near our table. \\n\\nI will say Diamond was our server and she was great.

We took the train down and walked a few blocks to reach the restaurant. We arrived before our reservation but were seated right away. We had a window view which made it great for people watching, but it definitely would be better in warmer weather because the windows seem like they could turn the restaurant into an open-air concept.\\nWhat we ordered: \\n\\nChicken and shrimp dumplings: Long chives, ginger, crispy chicken skin, steamed. Just your average dumpling. Nothing too unique about it, but they were tasty nonetheless.\\n\\nWagyu Beef Spring rolls: onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce was a star of this dish.  I could honestly drink it. It went really well with the spring rolls but made the dumplings much better. We honestly wanted to order like 6 more servings of these. SO GOOD.\\n\\nEel Avocado Roll A perfect balance of eel to avocado. It had a teriyaki-ish sauce on top.\\n\\nSpicy Tuna Roll  Just your normal spicy tuna roll, but it's my go-to. I definitely didn't need to eat any more sushi at this point in the meal, but I love trying them wherever I go. \\n\\nDragon Roll: crab, avocado, cucumber, topped with fried eel and avocados. \\n\\nDynamite White Tuna Roll: spicy walu, crunch, and shishitos.\\n\\nThey weren't kidding about the spice of this roll. The spice was at a good level between the spicy sauce and shishitos and the tuna seemed to balance it all out. Would definitely order this again.\\n\\n KJ Roll: seared scallops, Kani, cucumber, avocado, and wasabi aioli\\n\\nAlso delicious. Just the right about of heat and had a great amount of seafood in the roll\\n\\nRolls that weren't our favorite: \\n\\nBroad Street Roll: spicy salmon, avocado, crunch, soy paper, topped with king salmon and spicy salmon. No rice. \\n\\nThis was the roll that our server recommended. although it was good, it was probably my least favorite roll that we ordered. I'm not sure if I ever had a roll without rice, but it felt like it was missing something texturally. If you like salmon, you should order it, but it was just meh to me.\\n\\nOverall, we liked the Tuna Bar. The food and service were good, but the atmosphere was a bit loud for our liking. I think I saw that they have happy hour deals, but I know we definitely missed it by going on a Saturday night. I think the prices were reasonable for an upscale sushi joint. The drinks were a bit pricy, so we just had a drink (a Sapporo for him and Prosecco for me).\",\n",

I am a sushi snob having lived in NYC and Singapore for years, and this is the only place I've been to in Philly that remotely compares aside from Morimoto and Tomo. Their tuna is very fresh and high quality, the salmon and yellowtail are always very good and fresh too. They do a spicy tuna roll 'the right way' with little mayo and big pieces of sushi, as opposed to the mushy, orange paste-y consistency of most spicy tuna rolls I've had in Philly. The lobster fried rice is also very good with a fresh flavor but a little light on the lobster. I haven't tried anything else as of yet.\\n\\nWhat sets this place apart is their happy hour and daily specials - you can't beat it anywhere in The City! Salmon avocado, spicy salmon, or spicy tuna toll for $5! You can also choose from chicken and shrimp gyozas and a couple other items for $5. Drinks specials are $5 for the cocktail special and about $4 for beer and wine. Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday where you can get tuna tartare for $7, and Wednesday is hand rolls for $5. \\n\\nThe service is definitely one of my favorite things about this place. The bartenders are friendly and prompt and super professional. The atmosphere is really cool, a mix of rustic with an Old City feel.

We ended up getting a regular tuna roll along with king salmon, bluefin, and yellowtail sashimi. \\n\\nBy the end I was pleasantly full and buzzed haha. A great end. Anyway, for two people, we hit the $130s range. Expect to pay that much for dinner with drinks.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I came here as my cousin accidentally stumbled upon this sushi place and saw how it was always busy - so why not right? We managed to squeeze in early as it as a weekday after the rain and no one was exactly out. I highly recommend reservations here as they are literally always booked and it was my cousins 3rd try. Their sushi is extremely fresh and they do have very unique takes on rolls compared to what I have seen in the area. Our waitress extremely patient and kind. The decor is beautiful but of course its dim and romantic so you can't really see what you're eating either. Seating is small and parking is of course limited.\\n\\nEverything about the place is insta-ambiance worthy and picture perfect but I can't help but feel it was a little over-hyped. We got the Tuna Crudo which was delicious (aka tuna carpaccio as a comparison fyi) as an appetizer. As for the rolls, the only memorable one that is all over yelp and pictured everywhere is the broad street roll which is that salmon roll you see with the beautiful filters. I thought it was unique in that it had no rice and the fish was fresh but other than that I am not sure what I was expecting. If you want romantic lighting with your sushi and date, here is your place and it caters to the area!\",\n",

I'm so glad we did because it was the highlight of our trip! \\n\\nThis may be a bold statement, but Tuna Bar is the best sushi I've ever had (and I've tried a LOT of sushi). \\n\\nEven the atmosphere is so interesting. The lights and decor are clean and aesthetically pleasing. The hostess seated us immediately at our reservation time and handed us menus, as well as a drink menu. \\n\\nTo start, we ordered Sapporo beers, a Geisha (green tea, soju, sparkling white wine, green tea flakes), and a See You Later cocktail (which had rose petals on top). I had the Geisha, and it was a great pairing with the sushi- very light but flavorful. \\n\\nFor our appetizers, we split a tuna curdo (my favorite dish), tuna tartare, edamame, and a seared tuna salad. Everything was amazing and flavorful. The tuna was the best fish I've ever tasted. \\n\\nThe owner of the restaurant brought us complimentary shishito peppers, as well. They're simple but delicious! I'm actually craving them now. \\n\\nFor the rolls and sashimi, we ordered a variety- old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna roll, maguro sashimi, and a peanut avocado roll. I attached pictures of the menu that explains what's inside each. \\n\\nThe maguro sashimi was my favorite. It's just a piece of fish, but it was so tender and flavorful. Even the wasabi that I put on the fish was unique! Much different than the generic, gooey wasabi from every other sushi restaurant I've tried. \\n\\nI absolutely LOVE Tuna Bar- I wish they had one in New York, but that just means I'll have to visit Philly soon!\",\n",

I'll admit to being a creature of habit, so no one that knows me would be surprised that tonight, absent the prodding of my wife or friends, I ordered items that I had before.  \\n\\nI started with Grandmom's Wonton Soup because I needed something soothing.  I believe I tasted a very slight hint of vinegar in the broth.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but whatever it is, it provides a modern flare to the broth, to go along with the delicate and very tasty deconstructed wontons.  The dough used for the wontons is extremely light, and the sausage is more significant with great flavor.  My second course, the Wok Kampachi Ceviche, was not only as delicious as before, but this time the kampachi was a more generous serving than my earlier experience.  \\n\\nRather than a number of smaller dishes, tonight for my third course, I decided to order a larger entree.  The Salmon Shokiyaki proved to be just the right choice.  I like my cooked salmon to have a warm pink center, yet a slight crispness on the outside.  This dish was perfectly done with a warm pink center, slightly crisp, along with a glaze on it that I think may have been miso based.  I'm not sure about the glaze, but it doesn't matter because I'd order it again anyway.  \\n\\nBetween the food and a sampling of a few sake's, it was a great way to spend my free time.  At this restaurant, the only other thing I really wished they served might be an assortment of robatayaki.  Are you listening Ken?\",\n",

The waiter explain that he had \"forgotten\" about our salad order after nearly 35 minutes of waiting. My part visited during lunch and there must not have been more 10 people attending during our time. Ironically the salad was the best part of the meal.

That is inexcusable especially during a time for a heightened need for cleaning. I was hoping this would be a new sushi gem in philly but it was just underwhelming.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Hip, mid-century modern decorated sushi spot with some hits and some misses but overall a good time. \\n\\nCame with a party of 7 to celebrate my mom and aunt\\'s birthday. We opted not to bring a cake because they have a $45 cake fee. \\n\\nThe drinks here were strong and I quite enjoyed them. I tried the Winston\\'s heat, which was very much cucumber-y and refreshing, the NORI-Grets, which basically tasted like a margarita, and the Yuzu sour, which was a bit too sour for me. \\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes for the table, which came to around $400 with tip and tax. \\n\\nThings I\\'d recommend:\\n1. UNI: the uni here was surprisingly fresh (compared to a lot of their other fish). While MP was $12 a piece, I\\'d say it was pretty worth it. Not sure if the UNI is always this fresh, but we definitely came on a good day. \\n\\n2. Vegetable fried rice: I\\'m sure all the fried rices here are good (they have 3 different choices in total, a sausage one, a crab wasabi one, and a veggie one): We opted for the veggie rice and it was delicious - Super simple, but full of flavor. A bit greasy, but definitely a delicious and straightforward dish. \\n\\n3. Grandma\\'s Wonton soup: I didn\\'t try this, but this was a dish ordered for my grandmother (we thought a grandma soup would be good for a grandma lol). She really enjoyed this! These are Fuzhou style wontons so they\\'re super small, but she ate this entire dish and that doesn\\'t happen often - so they must\\'ve been authentic and delicious! \\n\\nThings I thought that were just OKAY: \\n1. The rolls: We ordered the eel avocado, California, avocado, and peanut avocado roll (lots of avocado lol). While they were pretty solid (was personally not a big fan of the peanut avocado roll), I\\'d say it really wasn\\'t anything special. I guess they presented it in an aesthetic way, but definitely not any better than the regular $5 lunch special rolls at a random sushi joint. If you\\'re a fan of sushi rolls, their rolls are definitely a safe option to order but again, they won\\'t wow you. \\n\\n2. Oysters: My mom actually really enjoyed the oysters, so this might be a preference thing. They weren\\'t bad by any means but I definitely didn\\'t like that the oysters were pre-seasoned and flavored. Whenever places do that it naturally makes me question the oyster freshness. We ordered 12 oysters in total, 6 East coast and 6 west coast. The oysters were around $3, which I thought was pretty pricey - especially because dollar oysters are pretty easy to find. I pay for $3 in NYC when I\\'ve missed happy hour and am REALLLLLLLY craving oysters, otherwise I can\\'t really justify the price - especially in Philadelphia and for the size/taste of these oysters. Again, not bad but not worth it in my book. \\n\\n3. Seaweed salad: We ordered this for my grandmother who\\'s pretty picky with what she eats. It tasted like standard seaweed salad. Not really sure what else to say about this one. \\n\\nThings I\\'d skip: \\n1. Tuna tartare: My cousin mentioned this was a dish that was pretty popular here so we decided to try it. Tuna didn\\'t taste very fresh. \\n\\n2. Big tuna sashimi: Tuna, again, didn\\'t taste fresh. I\\'m confused why this place is called tuna bar when their tuna doesn\\'t seem...great. Our waiter described this as an \"omakase\" but we chose to order and share with the table. The best part of this plate was the tuna rolls. The sashimi slices were fishy and honestly the color of the fatty tuna made me feel, for lack of better words, A BIT FISHY, about this place. \\n\\nOVERALL, this place is a fun time and has a great atmosphere. Their fish and tuna truly is...whatever, but I\\'d still recommend this spot for a nice date or hangout with friends / family.',\n",

       "  'text': \"So there seems to be some a few mixed reviews on this place and I honestly can't see why. It's a beautiful restaurant, the food and service was great and their specials were amazing. The ambience is perfect for a date night. We ordered the brussel sprouts which were nicely charred and doused in sweet and salty sauce, and the tuna tartare which isn't a super unique dish but it was done very well and it came with rice crackers to serve as a vehicle for the tuna. We also went with some happy hour rolls of spicy tuna, salmon avocado which were $5 each then a peanut avocado roll as well for $6. The peanut avocado roll is so simple and so good. I actually ordered a second one I liked it so much. I've had spicy tuna at more places than you can count, and this is exactly what you want when ordering spicy tuna. You can tell a restaurant knows what it's doing by the rice. Tuna bar knows what it's doing. Again, these aren't super original, but just done very well and a bit more refined than your typical fusion restaurant. We finished the meal with some Mochi for dessert that had 3 flavors and they were all delicious.\\n\\nSince there's a lack of happy hour info on Yelp, here's the down low on their happy hour. This could be the best happy hour deal in the whole city. It's Mon-Fri from 4:30-7. Drink options are: one sake (mine was only $4 and poured traditionally overflowing into a masu box), one house red and one house white wine for $7. We went with the white and it was pretty good. You have the options of 3 beers, Kirin, Kirin Lite, and Orion for $5, $4, $4 respectively. Then there's one rotating house cocktail for $7. The night we went, it was a gin martini made with craft vermouth which is a ridiculous deal for just $7. Judging the way they handled the sake alone I'm sure their bar program is excellent. I will return to confirm this.\\n\\nHappy hour food: 3 rolls for $5 each, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, and Salmon Avocado. There's also chicken and shrimp dumplings for $7, edamame for $4 and shrimp and oysters for $2 a piece. \\n\\nBonus tip: (as far as I know) every Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday. Spicy tuna rolls are $6 all day and tuna tartare is $7. Every Thursday is Toro Thursday. Negitoro rolls are $7 all day. \\n\\nJust come try this place for a happy hour, you'll never want to leave.\",\n",

We got 4 between the two of us. We also got the happy hour spicy tuna roll and spicy salmon roll. Again, really good. \\n\\nFrom end regular menu-make sure you order the Brussels sprouts (some of the best I've had in Philly) and the shishito peppers.

That said, Tuna Bar is a tremendously hip new addition to the Philadelphia restaurant scene. The food is of excellent quality and presentation, while the restaurant is chic with a New York City vibe. \\n\\nI actually ate there two nights in a row so that I could get a true taste of the cuisine.  The Wok Kampachi Ceviche was excellent but my favorite was the Scallop Crudo.  You should try Grandmom's Wonton Soup, which is a creative new rendition of the old time favorite that I highly recommend.  I even had my favorite roll, the Sindy roll, which I eat at the Maple Shade location. It was delicious as usual. \\n\\nThough Tuna Bar may borrow some rolls from the Yokohama menu, make no mistake, the food at Tuna Bar is original, upscale, and very creative.

It's just difficult to come by, while this sushi was not the best I have ever had, the experience was five stars. \\n\\nFirst, I love the ambience. This is a place that suits many occasions, first dates, get together with friends, lunch with a coworker, etc. I would say definitely more of an intimate setting, I came here with Megan F. for a lunch during a work break! Such great vibes. Love the bar area and full length windows, just adds to the ambience! \\n\\nWe tried their steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer and for rolls we split the J&J roll, peppered tuna roll, and the east roll. The east roll is just your standard salmon sushi roll, nothing too crazy.  The J&J is a great roll for people trying to transition into the sushi eating world of actual raw fish! Loved the seared tuna on the outside. Hands down, our favorite was the peppered tuna roll! I'm a spicy tuna roll enthusiast and I decided to switch it up with this roll. I have zero regrets, a definite must try and great chance of tuna palette.\\n\\n\\nOverall the place and the sushi varieties are very modern, definitely worth a try if you're near this area of philly!\",\n",

I have been to many sushi spots in the greater city and Philadelphia area but Tuna Bar\\'s sushi has the best overall quality and taste. Their speciality rolls are to die for. My personal favorites are the Sindy Roll, Rittenhouse Roll, and Hurts Roll. As for favorite appetizers, it is definitely the tuna flatbread and their oysters. Yum. \\n \\nDrinks and Cocktails: The best part about going to an amazing restaurant for food is having an amazing alcohol and drink selection to complement the meal. Personal favorite cocktails are the yuzu sour and the race street. If you\\'re a sake fan then definitely ask them about their wide variety of sake. Cheers! \\n\\nAmbience: The ambience and the atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing. The \"vibes\" are great. They are always playing great music that sets a positive mood for everyone. Big ups to whomever created that playlist! \\n\\nService: Last but certainly not the least, their service. Simply wow. Tuna bar has the best service. I have to give Ken, the owner, a thumbs up for creating such an amazing establishment with an amazing team. Their General Manager, Tina, was phenomenal. Her professionalism, positive attitude, and seasoned experience can be seen from a mile away. I remember on a busy Saturday night, she was juggling 5 things at once, but still managed to provide my family and I an amazing time. She was super friendly! The rest of the staff were A+ too! \\n\\nWould I go again? YES YES YES. \\n\\nRecommend to a friend? FOR SURE. \\n\\nStop reading and book your reservation now.',\n",

Modern with retro inspired decor, I felt thoroughly welcomed by the warm staff the second I walked through the door.

We started off with cocktails, the tequila for us both. While the smell let us know it was a generous pour, it was easy to drink and not overly sweet. We split 4 rolls in total: Fishtown, peppered tuna, dynamite tuna, and spicy salmon. The presentation was beautiful, and every roll was delicious, although my favorite was the Fishtown. It was clear that all of the fish and other ingredients were fresh! Our meal a bit pricey, which we expected, but worth the splurge for great sushi!\\n\\nAs others have stated, the service at Tuna Bar was simply outstanding. The owner himself even stopped by before the end of our meal to inquire how we were doing. A lovely dining experience overall!',\n",

I understand that it was the first opening day and some hiccups are to be expected, but Friday is quite beyond.  First we arrived at our reservation time of 7:30.  Once we arrived we were told by the very disheveled matradee that they were running about 30 minutes late.  No issue so we took a walk around the block.  We arrived back at 8 and were told we were the 2nd table to be seated after 1 couple and they were cleaning 2 tables at that moment.  We sat on the bench at which point I watched him seat 2 couples.  Then another customer who showed up later than us went and said something and he sat them at a 4 top.  At that point I went back up and he looked at his computer and couldn't find my name. He eventually found it and looked confused.  He said I'll be the next couple and said here's a $25 gift card.  It was only $15 when I opened at home.  We waited another 15 minutes at which point a waiter started going to everyone including us to tell us they were out of food.  \\n\\nThere were multiple chances to tell us they would be out.  Instead we waited and waited, watched other people be seated when we were due to be next.  I rather write to you directly then putting my review on social sites as I think you should know about my full experience.  The waiter did give us a $50 gift card as he did with others for running out of food.    I emailed the restaurant direct with no response.  DONE\",\n",

The only thing I thought (and maybe it wasn't appropriate for me to expect?) was that there would be an introduction to the sushi sampler/omakase we ordered.

I enjoyed the Rittenhouse Sq Roll thoroughly and the J&J was good to taste. The fried oysters and sushi samplers weren't my favorite. The fried oysters were too sea watery for my taste, and the sushi samplers didn't feel too fresh to me.\\n\\nPrice - 2/5\\n\\nFor the price of the food, I would expect a little more from the food and service itself.

However, when we got there, it wouldn\\'t have been an issue to get a table - but we also went at 8 Pm on a Wednesday:) \\n\\nStarters:\\n\\nBlood orange fluke - best part of the meal. The fluke was so gooood and went really well with the capers, blood orange, and radish pieces! I couldn\\'t get enough! A must ORDER!! \\n\\nRock shrimp: this was good as well!! I liked it because it wasn\\'t coveredddd in sauce or heavily fried. It was the perfect balance of sauce and batter  - there was radish pieces as well - which I loved! Gave it a nice, refreshing crunch to your bite. \\n\\nLobster rice - this was just your usual fried rice ... with lobster and mushrooms. Some at my table said it was too salty - I think it was the mushrooms - but the rice itself was decent. I\\'d order it if I wanted fried rice \\u200d\\n\\nSoba noodles with shrimp - this was good too. My pick over the rice, actually. However, we had this after the rock shrimp and fluke - and those seemed to be the best! \\n\\nSushi: \\n\\nSushi was decent. But nothing heavenly delicious. I have yet to find a good sushi place in Philly  however, the starters were really good, which would make me want to go back and try the other dishes besides the sushi. Sushi wasn\\'t bad, but it wasn\\'t amazing either. But good place to go to take care of that sushi craving! \\n\\nThe sushi that we tried....\\n\\nJ&J : this was the best out of the 3 we got. It tasted fresh and flavorful. It had a bit of a rich taste which made you feel full after 2! \\nBroad street: this was okay. Too many ingredients made the sushi feel soggy and the flavors didn\\'t seem to have .... flavor. Just wasn\\'t a good combo, in my opinion.\\nDynamite : your typical rollllll- which isn\\'t a bad thing. Smaller than the first two, good to have a traditional roll with your specialities!',\n",

This place is gorgeous! From the wood bar to the cool fans, you get the trendy ambiance that is often missing from sushi spots. \\n\\nThe bar menu was small but each drink was really interesting. It's clear that they are committed to craft cocktails and keeping an upscale bar. Our waiter also informed us that a lengthy sake menu will be arriving soon.  \\n\\nThe food was delicious! Started with the rock shrimp. Perfect. Moved on to the lobster fried rice which was extremely flavorful and not at all greasy. Had a few rolls for our main course all of which were extremely fresh and with a good rice to fish ratio. \\n\\nThe service was friendly, knowledgeable and not at all overwhelmed or (seemingly) stressed considering it was open weekend.

A lot of the special sushi rolls that sounded good were mainly tuna though. I would like to see more choices with another type of fish, but can't complain too much hence the name, Tuna Bar. \\n\\nAlthough the food was amazing, the service could be better. It took a little longer for our server to come check on us after the food came out. It was later in the evening, so I figured they were busy closing out on a few other tables - fair enough. However, we were then not checked on again for another 30-40 minutes after we were done eating. We all kind of just sat there with empty plates and water glasses wondering if we should ask the hostess to track them down. The restaurant was not busy at all at this point...maybe four tables throughout the whole restaurant (with 3 or so servers working) and a few people at the bar. Nonetheless, we will be back as the location and food outweighs the hit or miss service.\",\n",

The bar is made out of pieces of wood that kinda scream Fixer Upper is on the DVR. The vibe of the place was urban and perfect for its location. For apps we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Tuna Crudo, Miso Soup and the Pork Gyoza. \\n\\nThe Miso was $6 bucks, when I asked my companion was it $6 bucks worthy there was a reply of lacking flavor but the size was equivalent to 2 $3 bowls somewhere else. \\nThe Brussel Sprouts: Now I confess I hadn't had brussel sprouts since at least 12 and that pushing it but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try them roasted instead of boiled and I am now a fan. The sesame oil was perfect and they were charred just enough to elicit the flavor of the sprouts to be slightly sweet.\\nTuna Crudo: My companions loved this dish and advised the truffle oil was slightly overwhelming but delectable.\\nPork Gyoza: Always good and great with the left over truffle oil\\n\\nThe perk of sitting at the bar was watching the chefs make the rolls and trying to figure out which one was ours. There is a mirror above the bar and more than once did we find ourselves staring at what was going on. We ordered 4 rolls to share: Fishtown, Old City, J&J and the Real California. The J&J was my favorite the shishito pepper would kick in right at the end for a spicy finish. The Old City looked to be the most popular coming off the bar and it made sense - its a instagramable plate in its own right and has a good flavor combo. I initially ordered the Fishtown and depending on what piece of fish you got on top kinda determined if it worked in my opinion. We decided to try the Real California roll for fun and honestly I could have done without.\\n\\nOverall I liked it and would try it again. I do wonder if they are going to rotate rolls to keep it fresh.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This place gets 10/5 for ambiance! It's in a great location and it's so modern inside and provides a great atmosphere for a girls night, date night, friend date, family date, etc. etc. etc. Outdoor seating is available. They have the ceiling to floor doors that they open wide during a nice night which gives you the feel of eating outside even when you are dining indoors. It's relatively small inside so I definitely recommend making a reservation if our plan to come at a busy time. \\n\\nThe service was good. A little slow but we weren't in a rush so it worked for us.\\n\\nWe came during happy hour and got two spicy tuna rolls and two spicy salmon rolls (which are $5 each at happy hour prices). It took a while for them to come out. I actually thought she forgot about them. They were just ok. \\n\\nMy friend got the edamame which she enjoyed. I got a ginger salad. It said it had avocado so I assumed they were just trying to be different by calling it a ginger salad instead of an avocado salad. Most sushi restaurants that I go to have an avocado salad on the menu with ginger dressing and it has at least a half of an avocado on top. This salad came out almost immediately after I ordered it and it was super cold which makes me feel like it's one of those restaurants that pre-makes salads and keeps them in a fridge or cooler. The avocado was so sparse I barely even knew it was in there. Not what I'm used to! To be fair, I assumed it was the avocado salad that I get at other sushi restaurants. \\n\\nWe split the lobster fried rice because so many people raves about it in the reviews. It was decent. Not amazing. It was kind of egg-y; I felt like that was the dominant flavor. \\n\\nThe other special rolls I ordered are pretty forgettable. One was a KJ, I believe. That's all I really remember. I don't remember what the other one was even called or what was in either of them. What's not forgettable is the price point of these unforgettable rolls. Their special rolls cost $15 to $21 per roll. ($21? Seriously?) They were falling apart as we tried to pick them up with the chopsticks. The wasabi was more mild than I'm used to. \\n\\nThe bathrooms are individual rooms for one person at a time. There was different music playing in the bathroom and it felt like a dance party. I was jamming out in there. Lol. \\n\\nThere is kiosk parking located nearby. Just a short walk will get you there. I'm not sure of any lots. \\n\\nThis place is great for the atmosphere but I've had wayyyyyy better sushi at a way lower price point. I feel like you are paying for the location more than anything. While I loved the ambiance, I don't really know that it would be worth returning to. I have sushi so infrequently that if I'm in the mood for it, I would rather go somewhere with better sushi and maybe not as awesome of an environment than mediocre, overpriced sushi in a modern, breezy location. \\n\\nThis is a miss for me and I can't really recommend it...unless you really want to pay a lot for mediocre sushi.\",\n",

Ambience was great but you cannot hear the third person on either side of you because it was so loud. The server didn't come for 15 minutes at least to follow up on our orders every time, So it took us 30 minutes to get our order in after sitting down.The rolls were good, but instead of the usual eight pieces I would expect for this kind of special doll price, they only came with seven and were small on top of that. Appetizers were extremely small and I think there was four pieces of shrimp and a $12 rock shrimp appetizer, each one barely 2 g in weight.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh, clean, modern, and beautiful the restaurant was. After sitting for 10 minutes, I noticed that my date and I still had not been approached by any server. Finally, after getting our drink and dinner order in, we received our food. The first two courses were served promptly, the last main course, not so prompt. Honestly, the food was just average. This disappointed me as I was expecting the food to match the beautiful decor.  I was also not impressed with the lack of service. I really had high hopes for this place but it let my partner and I down in two crucial areas: food and service. Needless to say, our check, which was above $100, did not seem to meet what we got. To anyone wanting to try Tuna Bar and are willing to spend above $100, try the many other restaurants in the city where quality meets the price point.  Only then will you know why Tuna Bar falls short.',\n",

We ordered some rolls ($5-6 for the happy hour California roll and $8-9 for the ones pictured off the regular menu). Spicy salmon roll was my favorite. The fried chicken dish was awesome and came in an awesome sauce (pictured after I ate a few, apologies) \\n\\nThis place satisfied for happy hour and we ordered 5 plates or so plus 2 drinks and only paid 55 bucks before tip.

       "  'text': \"I have been to Tuna Bar a couple of times, the first time a shortly after it opened and the second time more recently. The first time, we were very impressed by the quality of the fish and the preparation of our food. The second time, the quality was still very good but it wasn't prepared as well as the first time we visited. Since this restaurant is fairly expensive, we were slightly disappointed. \\n\\nThe food we ordered included miso soup, tuna tartare, Old City Roll, Fishtown roll, White Tuna Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll. We really enjoyed the tuna tartare and the Old City Roll, although the rock shrimp on Old City Roll were not cooked as tender as the first time we went. The fish in the other rolls was very good quality, but we were not too impressed by the overall rolls themselves. \\n\\nMost recently we were here on a Thursday and there was supposedly a happy hour on the lychee martini that featured the drink for $5. We were told when we sat down around 7pm that the happy hour was still going on and we could order the martini with the discounted price, which we did. The martini was delicious, however, when we went to pay the bill, our drinks were listed as full price and the same waitress we had since he beginning of the meal told us that we ordered after the happy hour was over. Therefore I would say the service we received was not the best...\\n\\nOverall I am hesitant about coming back here, especially because Kisso and Tomo are two other great japanese restaurants within a block radius.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I was excited to see Tuna Bar open in my Old City neighborhood. Adding a Japanese restaurant to the neighborhood seemed like a great idea even though I'm not a fan of sushi. I hoped it would also have food for non sushi lovers and thankfully it does. \\n\\nUpon walking in i noticed the restaurant has a nice warm modern decor. I ordered a bunch of items with my dinner companion and we shared. We ordered dumplings, edamame, lobster fried rice, shrimp tempura sushi, and bone-in steak. The dumplings were good, but not as flavorful as the best dumplings I've tasted. The lobster fried rice was the standout. It's a large delicious bowl, with enough lobster to actually taste, and you have plenty to take home at the end. The steak was a perfectly cooked and juicy medium. But it was a fatty piece of steak. I had to trim some of the fat myself, which was slightly annoying. But once the fat was trimmed I was in steak heaven.  Remember, I'm not a fan of sushi but I did enjoy the shrimp tempura sushi. Guess I can like sushi as long as the fish is cooked. I also had a rum & coke, which was mixed well but missing the lime. The bar probably focuses on fancier cocktails as opposed to the old classics. \\n\\nTuna Bar is a welcome addition to Old City.\",\n",

Beware of the specials though, those prices add up! We had a 3 piece fatty tuna special for $21 and 2 piece yellowtail for $20. That's $41 for 5 pieces of fish. Coulda had 12 mediocre takeout rolls for that price, so it's hard to wrap my head around. But it was really good! They also had some fun looking fancy rolls and we tried the Fishtown Roll -with jalapeno and assorted fish wrapped around shrimp tempura which was very good.\\n\\nWe also enjoyed some apps and sides- the bang bang shrimp, brussel sprouts, lobster fried rice (large portion), and the wok fried crudo were all very good. Before we knew it our check was about $100 each. Not sure if there was dessert, since our waiter just brought the check and rushed us out a bit....\\n\\nThe place was busy on a Thursday night, despite it being in a bit of an odd location). The waiters seemed a bit stressed and the area they had to navigate was so narrow they seemed to constantly be excusing themselves or squeezing past each other. Hopefully they'll get into the groove of things as time goes on.\\n\\nNext time you're looking to sit down and really enjoy some melt in your mouth fish not being delivered in under 35 minutes for you to watch with Netflix with, definitely try Tuna Bar!\",\n",

It was a mezcal drink with lime and jalapeño syrup that was absolutely delicious. My friend later ordered a gin martini with wasabi -\\xa0the taste was really fresh and interesting but the wasabi wasn't mixed in well and she encountered a few larger nuggets which made the drink a little weird. \\n\\nWe ordered several plates and highlights for me were the lobster fried rice, crispy rock shrimp, fishtown roll and one of the specials of the day, some fresh yellowtail, which was absolutely incredible. \\n\\nIf there is dessert on the menu, we wouldn't know, because our check was dropped without us even asking for it. Not exactly the warm vibe I'm expecting when spending upwards of $100/person. Hopefully, the restaurant is simply going through the stress of opening. I'm looking forward to another visit after they have had a bit more time to get things running smoothly.\",\n",

I was really craving sushi so when my girlfriend recommended this place I was totally into it. I definitely did not expect to have a new favorite sushi spot!\\n\\nWhen I say early dinner, I'm talking 5pm which means we made it just in time for happy hour. Their happy hour deals include wines, one of their signature cocktails (I believe it was a whiskey cocktail on the day that we went) and a select few bites. Although we passed on their drink specials, we did order their $6 dumplings and a spicy salmon roll. As for drinks, we both ordered off of the cocktail list. She got the Shiso Picate which comes with mezcal and jalapeño and I got the Winston's Heat with gin, wasabi and cucumber. We both loved our drinks - so much so that we were happy to get a second round!\\n\\nAside from the happy hour food that we got, we also ordered the fried Brussels sprouts, Tuna Tartare, and the Fishtown roll. The Brussels sprouts came in a fairly large bowl and were fantastic. I'm a huge fan of Brussels sprouts and and these were some of the best I've had in Philly - and trust me I've had my fair share! The tuna was a choice my friend made and it was also very good. Lastly the roll we got was so delicious and very filling! It was loaded with shrimp tempura and fish. \\n\\nThe restaurant is very pretty, clean and spacious. Staff was attentive and checked up on us frequently. \\n\\nI can't wait to drop in to Tuna Bar again soon when the next sushi craving hits!\",\n",

The staff and service were fantastic.  Our waiter, Brion, was attentive to our needs and quick to provide recommendations (which turned out incredible!).  Ken Sze, the owner/executive chef also came out towards the end of our meal to make sure we were happy and satisfied.  We chatted with him on our way out and he was very pleasant!  \\n\\nOnto the food!  We had a number of appetizers.  We tried the scallop crudo on recommendation and this was one of the best dishes of the night.  This MELTS in your mouth.  You must have this.  We also had the pork gyoza, creamy rock shrimp, mai fried rice, and wagyu beef egg rolls.  All were delicious and would highly recommend.  The wagyu beef egg rolls were on special but I asked that they put it on the full menu when it is released!  \\n\\nWe got 4 sushi rolls- the Old City, Fishtown, Spicy Salmon, and California roll.  All were absolutely delectable - super fresh, and really flavorful.  We finished off with ice cream for the table - the chocolate and the green tea.  So rich and creamy!\\n\\nOverall, our experience was awesome and this is such a great addition to the Philly sushi scene.  I will definitely be coming back.

I like that they do happy hour at the tables as well - so much more comfortable when there are 4+ people in your party. Their happy hour food specials are great - three types of rolls, and not eensy ones either. The four of us split seven rolls and two bowls of edamame between us, and I was pretty full. We also got two rounds of sake, and the total was about $80 - not bad at all. They also had a happy hour cocktail (sounded too sweet for me), and wine, not sure about beer. But I'm glad I went with the sake - maybe a bit kitschy, but I love how they pour and let the excess spill over into a box. The server was very polite and helpful even though we were probably not making his life easy (not all arriving at the same time, not ordering all the food at the same time, squeezing in a second happy hour round, etc.). He also was helpful when explaining what foods were good for gluten-intolerance.\",\n",
